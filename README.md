# Eyl Shell

This is a toy project to attempt to write a simple Weston desktop shell using
Rust. This repository also contains a Wayland library which will be moved into a
separate repository when it works. Everything is very preliminary and likely
doesn't work. Oops.

## Building

Run `cargo build`.
